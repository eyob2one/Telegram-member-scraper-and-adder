How it works

- Install Python 3
- Install any text editor (eg. Vscode)
- Install telethon using cmd command: 
```markdown 
pip3 install telethon
```
- Get your Api and Hash id from www.my.telegram.org/auth
- add each ids between the quotes in line 26 and 27 respectively to scrapper.py
- Do the same as the previous step in adder.py
- Run scrapper.py and scrap group members.
- Run adder.py and add scrapped members to your group


Basically it scrapes member from group where the logined id is admin and it creates a .csv file.
And the "adder" reads .csv file and add member to the target group.  
```markdown
 ___            ___          __                     ____________ 
|   \          /   |         | |                   |____    ____|
| |\ \        / /| |   ___   | |         ___            |  |     
| | \ \      / / | |  / __ \ | |_____   / __ \   _      |  |     
| |  \ \    / /  | | | |  | ||  __   | | |  | | |_|     |  |     
| |   \ \  / /   | | | |__| || |__|  | | |__| |         |  |     
|_|    \_\/_/    |_|  \ ___/ |_______|  \____/          |__|     
```
