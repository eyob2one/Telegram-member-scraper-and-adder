How it works

- You must install Python 3
- Install any text editor (Not necessary )
- Install telethon using cmd command: pip3 install telethon\
- Get your Api and Hash id from www.my.telegram.org/auth
- add each ids between the quotes in line 26 and 27 respectively to scrapper.py
- Do the same as the previous step in adder.py
- Run scrapper.py and scrap group members.
- Run adder.py and add scrapped members to your group


Basically it scrapes member from group where the logined id is admin and it creates a .csv file.
And the "adder" reads .csv file and add member to the target group.
